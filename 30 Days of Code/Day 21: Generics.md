## Day 21: Generics

#### Objective
Today we're discussing Generics; be aware that not all languages support this construct, so fewer languages are enabled for this challenge. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

#### Task
Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

**Note:** You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.

#### Input Format

The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your printArray function.

#### Constraints

- You must have exactly 

    function named printArray.

#### Output Format

Your printArray function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.
