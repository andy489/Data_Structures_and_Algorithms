## Day 29: Bitwise AND

Objective
Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given set
. Find two integers, and (where ), from set such that the value of is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, . In this case,

represents the bitwise AND operator.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,
, the number of test cases.
Each of the subsequent lines defines a test case as space-separated integers, and

, respectively.

#### Constraints

Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of

on a new line.

#### Sample Input
```
3
5 2
8 5
2 2
```
#### Sample Output
```
1
4
0
```
#### Explanation

All possible values of and

are:

The maximum possible value of that is also is , so we print on a new line.
