, is defined as:

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if
, we calculate and get

.

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

    n: an integer

**Note:** Factorials of
can't be stored even in a

long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
